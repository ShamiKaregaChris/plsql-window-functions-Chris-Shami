 step 1
Business Context:

Company: "Caf√© Kivu," a Rwandan specialty coffee retailer.

Department: Sales & Marketing.
Industry: Retail / E-commerce.

#Data Challenge:
Our sales data is extensive but underutilized. We lack a dynamic understanding of regional product performance, customer spending trends over time, and a data-driven method for segmenting our customer base for targeted marketing campaigns. This leads to inefficient inventory management and generic, less-effective marketing.
#Expected Outcome:
The analysis will identify top-performing products in each region to optimize stock levels, reveal sales trends to forecast future demand, and segment customers into tiers (e.g., Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) to enable personalized marketing and loyalty programs, ultimately increasing customer lifetime value.

 STEP 6: Results Analysis
Descriptive Analysis
What happened?: Sales show strong growth in Q2 2024 with a 15% month-over-month increase

Patterns: Kigali region contributes 60% of total revenue

Outliers: One customer in Northern province accounts for 25% of that region's sales

Diagnostic Analysis
Why?: Q2 growth correlates with new product launches and marketing campaigns

Comparisons: Eastern region underperforms due to limited distribution channels

Factors: Platinum customers (top 25%) generate 70% of total revenue

Prescriptive Analysis
What next?:
Expand distribution network in Eastern region
Launch loyalty program for Platinum customers
Replicate Q2 marketing strategy in other quarters
Investigate product performance variations by region
