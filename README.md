Business Context:

Company: "Caf√© Kivu," a Rwandan specialty coffee retailer.

Department: Sales & Marketing.
Industry: Retail / E-commerce.

#Data Challenge:
Our sales data is extensive but underutilized. We lack a dynamic understanding of regional product performance, customer spending trends over time, and a data-driven method for segmenting our customer base for targeted marketing campaigns. This leads to inefficient inventory management and generic, less-effective marketing.
#Expected Outcome:
The analysis will identify top-performing products in each region to optimize stock levels, reveal sales trends to forecast future demand, and segment customers into tiers (e.g., Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) to enable personalized marketing and loyalty programs, ultimately increasing customer lifetime value.
